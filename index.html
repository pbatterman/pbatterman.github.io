            <h2>More about me</h2> <!--24601-->
              <p>
               I am a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania studying Digital Media Design. What is Digital Media Design, you may ask? The name doesn't do it justice, but it's a computer science degree at the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science with an emphasis on computer graphics and design. I have the same foundations as any Computer Science major, such as algorithms, data structures, and computing systems. Additionally, a good portion of my coursework is dedicated to studying the arts. Some of my more recent interests are mechanical design, advertising, and the oxford comma.

               For relevant coursework, please check out my <a href="images/10.6.2014_WEB_resume.pdf" id = "link" >resume</a>.</p>
              </br>  
            <p>I have a great passion for the arts, primarily graphic design, but also in theatrical design, painting, drawing, photography, and carpentry. I do a lot of freelance graphic design work around campus, and am currently involved with a number of Penn's student theater companies. For the highlights of my artistic endeavors, please see my <a href="portfolio.html" id = "link" >portfolio</a>.</p>
          </br>
            <h3> Fun facts for friendly folks: </h3>
            <p>I am the PR chair for <a href="http://www.pennthetatau.com" id = "link" >Theta Tau</a>, Penn's premier co-educational professional engineering fraternity. </p>
            <p>I play a variety of instruments, including, but not limited to: guitar, piano, and drums. I can also raise each eyebrow independently of the other, and can wiggle my right ear. My favorite font is currently Montserrat, as found in the header of this website. </p>
