            <h2>More about me</h2> <!--24601-->
              <p>
               I am a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania studying Digital Media Design. What is Digital Media Design, you may ask? It's a computer science degree at the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science with an emphasis on computer graphics and design. I have the same foundation as a Computer Science major, such as algorithms, data structures, and computing systems. The rest of my coursework is dedicated to studying art and design. Some of my more recent interests are mechanical design, advertising, and the oxford comma.

               For relevant coursework, please check out my <a href="images/current_resume_WEB.pdf" class="link" >resume</a>.</p>
              </br>  
            <p>I have a great passion for the arts, primarily graphic design, but also in theatrical design, painting, drawing, photography, and carpentry. I do a lot of freelance graphic design work around campus, and am currently involved several of Penn's student theater companies. For the highlights of my artistic endeavors, please see my <a href="portfolio.html" class="link" >portfolio</a>.</p>

            <p>I am the Public Relations chair for <a href="http://www.pennthetatau.com" class="link" >Theta Tau</a>, Penn's premier co-educational professional engineering fraternity. </p>
            <p>I play a variety of instruments, including, but not limited to: guitar, piano, and drums. I can also raise each eyebrow independently of the other, and can wiggle my right ear.</p>
