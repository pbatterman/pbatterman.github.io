            <h2> Who am I? </h2> <!--24601-->
              </br>
              <p>
               I am a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania studying Digital Media Design. What is Digital Media Design, you may ask? It's different for every single student; it's an amalgamation of Computer Science, Design, and miscellaneous electives. My favorite explanation of Digital Media Design is as follows: </p> 
               <p> <i> We may not necessarily the best programmers or the best artists, but of the programmers, we're the best artists, and of the artists, we're the best programmers.</i> </p> 
               <p> (Realistically, it's a computer science degree with an emphasis on computer graphics and design). For relevant coursework, please check out my <a href="images/10.6.2014_WEB_resume.pdf" id = "link" >resume</a>.</p>
              </br>  
          </br>
            <h3> As to the shoes on my hands: </h3>
            <p>I have a great passion for the arts, primarily graphic design, but also in theatrical design, painting, drawing, photography, and carpentry. I do a lot of freelance graphic design work around campus, and am currently involved with a number of Penn's student theater companies. For the highlights of my artistic endeavors, please see my <a href="portfolio.html" id = "link" >portfolio</a>.</p>
          </br>
            <h3> Fun facts for friendly folks: </h3>
            <p>I am a brother of <a href="www.pennthetatau.com" id = "link" >Theta Tau</a>, Penn's premier co-educational professional engineering fraternity. </p>
            <p>I play a variety of instruments, including, but not limited to: guitar, piano, and drums. I can also raise each eyebrow independently of the other, and can wiggle my right ear. My favorite font is currently Montserrat. </p>
